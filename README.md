# 📄 Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator

This project is a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** application for simulating **Page Replacement Algorithms** using **Python** and **Tkinter**. It allows users to input a reference string, select a page replacement algorithm, and visualize the results.

## ✨ Features
✅ **Supports the following algorithms:**  
- 🟢 **FIFO** (First In First Out)  
- 🟢 **LRU** (Least Recently Used)  
- 🟢 **Optimal Page Replacement**  
- 🟢 **MRU** (Most Recently Used)  

✅ **Displays** step-by-step execution results in a table.  
✅ **Shows** total page faults for the selected algorithm.  
✅ **Saves** results to a file: `page_replacement_results.txt`.  
✅ **Provides** a graphical comparison of page faults for different algorithms.

## ⚙️ **Requirements**
- **Python 3.x**  

### 📦 **Required Libraries:**
- **tkinter** (Usually pre-installed with Python)  
- **ttk** (Comes with tkinter)  
- **matplotlib**  

#### **To install any missing dependencies:**

```bash

pip install matplotlib


🚀 How to Run
Clone or Download the project.

Navigate to the project directory.

Run the script using:

python page_replacement_simulator.py

🏃 Usage Instructions
Enter the Reference String — A comma-separated sequence of page numbers.

Example: 7,0,1,2,0,3,4,2,3,0,3,2

Enter the Number of Frames — The capacity of the frame buffer.

Example: 3

Select the Algorithm — Choose from:

FIFO, LRU, Optimal, or MRU.

Run Simulation — Click the "Run Simulation" button.

View Results — See the step-by-step output in the table.

Plot Results — Click "Plot Graph" to compare performance.

📁 Output
Results are displayed in the GUI.

Results are saved to a file named page_replacement_results.txt.

The graph shows a bar chart comparing total page faults.

📊 Sample Graph Output
The bar chart compares the total page faults for the four algorithms.

🔍 Example
Reference String: 7, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 4, 2, 3, 0, 3, 2

Number of Frames: 3

Algorithm: FIFO

Output file (page_replacement_results.txt):

Algorithm: FIFO
Total Page Faults: 9
Step | Page | Frames       | Page Fault
1    | 7    | [7]          | Yes
2    | 0    | [7, 0]       | Yes
3    | 1    | [7, 0, 1]    | Yes
4    | 2    | [0, 1, 2]    | Yes
