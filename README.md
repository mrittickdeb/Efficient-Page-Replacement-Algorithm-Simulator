# Efficient Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator

This project simulates various page replacement algorithms.

## Features
- FIFO, LRU, and Optimal Page Replacement algorithms
- Performance comparison
- Visual representation of memory usage

The development of the Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator project was a multi-step process that involved designing the user interface, choosing appropriate algorithms to implement, developing the application using Reactjs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Firebase, and deploying the application on AWS Amplify. The following are the steps involved in the development of this project:
After designing the user interface, the next step was to choose the algorithms to implement. The following algorithms were implemented in the project:

1. First-In-First-Out (FIFO) algorithm
2. Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm
3. Most Recently Used (MRU) algorithm
4. Optimal Page Replacement (OPR) algorithm



The Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator project comes with several features that make it a useful tool for studying and comparing different page replacement algorithms. Some of the important features of the project are:
The user interface is intuitive and easy to use, even for non-technical users.
The application supports multiple page replacement algorithms, including FIFO, LRU, MRU, and OPR.
The application simulates page replacement in real-time, allowing users to visualize the performance of different algorithms.
The application generates interactive charts that show the performance of different algorithms over time.
